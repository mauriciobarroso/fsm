# Multi-Function Button Example

This example shows how to implement a multi-function button handler using a finite state machine (FSM). It supports:

- A configurable **debounce** mechanism to eliminate contact bounce  
- Detection of **single click**, **double click**, and **long press**  
- Customizable callback functions for each event  
- Simple integration in a periodic loop via `fsm_run`  
- A self-contained demonstration with no external dependencies beyond the FSM core

| DEBOUNCE | N/A                   | Read GPIO level | N/A  |
| PRESSED  | N/A                   | Read GPIO level | N/A  |
| RELEASED | N/A                   | Read GPIO level | N/A  |
| SINGLE   | Print "Single Click!" | N/A             | N/A  |
| DOUBLE   | Print "Double Click!" | Read GPIO level | N/A  |
| LONG     | Print "Long Click!"   | Read GPIO level | N/A  |
